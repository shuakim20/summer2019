    <br><h3>So, how?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="steps">
    <br><a>1</a><number>1. Find a place with a large circle-shaped table; no oval or tiny circle, just big circle table</number>
    <br><a>2</a><number>2. Place 13 chairs if it doesn’t already have one; doesn’t matter what kind of chairs<sup>2</sup></number>
    <br><a>3</a><number>3. Choose one person who would be a timekeeper<sup>3</sup></number>
    <br><a>4</a><number>4. Place one person per seat<sup>4</sup></number>
    <br><a>5</a><number>5. Timekeeper gets a timer</number>
    <br><a>6</a><number>6. Where timekeeper is sitting in the starting/restarting point of the clock</number>
    <br><a>7</a><number>7. Whoever is sitting next to the timekeeper, whether on the left or right, the clock starts to go from whichever direction that the timekeeper chooses to go</number>
    <br><a>8</a><number>8. Hand a device or a flashlight that is able to shine a bright light to the starting person</number>
    <br><a>9</a><number>9. Timekeeper calls out whichever phrase or indicator that they want to use to inform the rest of the people the change of hour</number>
    <br><a>10</a><number>10. Flashlight/light shine-able device gets passed on every hour to the person sitting next to the current device holder<sup>5</sup></number>
    <br><a>11</a><number>11. Make sure the timekeeper has an indicator that tells whether the time is AM or PM<sup>6</sup></number>
    <br><a>12</a><number>12. Repeat/continue this until whoever stops using the table clock<sup>7</sup></number>

    <li>But must be able to shine a solid light. The persno who looks at the clock must be able to question, "Oh, what is this light on this table?"</li>
    <li>Literally any sort of chairs as long as it looks visually pleasing. Invisible chairs are more than welcome to use--good exercise!</li>
    <li>Yes, this role seems special and all, but the person then wouldn't be able to play with the cool flashlight effects.</li>
    <li>They are allowed to do any work they want on the table; whether reading a book, using their laptop to do work, writing the next greatest novel in the world, etc.</li>
    <li>Whoever was holding the device and hears the change of hour from the timekeeper, then hand over the device. Doesn’t matter whether the clock goes clockwise or counterclockwise, but it must go in the same direction since the beginning.</li>
    <li>The timekeeper is allowed to check whether the time is AM or PM every two hours by using a real clock so that the clock becomes more accurate--but other than that, the timekeeper is not allowed to look at the real-time.</li>
    <li>I hope no one uses this clock for 24/7.</li>
