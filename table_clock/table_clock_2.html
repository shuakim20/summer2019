        <h2>Table</h2>
        <p>
          I was sitting in an empty classroom--only consisted of a green chalkboard, big windows, a computer, and a big circle table with 12 chairs. Frankly, I was forcing myself to come up with ideas for making a clock, but suddenly, the surrounding environment inspired me. I’ve decided to make an interactive clock, a clock that no one has ever used or even imagined before. The overall shape of the clock was a perfect circle, which reminded me of a normal clock that people use in their daily lives. But the method of indicating the exact time of the environment remained mysterious at that time.

          <h2>Desk Lamp</h2>
          <p>
            To sketch out my inspiration of table clock, I set myself into a huge library, that was filled with people and books--a very quiet space. A sudden inspiration came into my mind again. A desk lamp, which eventually led me to think of using “light” as a source of indication for time. Instead of purchasing 12 individual desk lamps, using whatever device that people have on a daily basis, (usually, phones) that is just able to shine a light became a feasible alternative.

              <p>
                As the purpose of the table for people to sit around and use it for a variety of reasons, I couldn’t dare to miss out on the main purpose of a table. As a result, 13 people (12 of the time indicators and 1 timekeeper) sitting around the table would satisfy the original purpose of the table in addition to using it as a clock.
