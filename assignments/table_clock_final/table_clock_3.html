      Tips for the <em>timekeeper</em>
    </div>
    <p>
      As you could notice from the <em>how</em> part of making table clock, timekeeper is an important role in it. As a result, there are few tips that I have for the timekeeper:
    </p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">
        <ul>
          <li>The timekeeper must be a person with a strong leadership</li>
          <li>The timekeeper must not fall asleep or lose track of people; who is holding flashlight</li>
          <li>Please, please, please. Keep track of the timer. Don't get distracted. It is a very focus-required task.</li>
          <li>Do not be indecisive. Just choose a direction and start, geez</li>
        </ul>

      Protocol
    </div>
    <p> Sometimes, there are unexpected things that the user could confront. In case of any emergency, follow these protocols:</p>
    <div class="p-box">
      <ul>
        <li>If the battery of the light device runs out, then inform the timekeeper about it and make sure the timekeeper pauses the timer. Then, carefully replace the old battery with a new one. If the clock performer is using a device that requires to charge it from the outlet, then simply just change the device into a different one that is charged up!</li>
        <li>If the flashlight or the device holder needs to be out of the table for any circumstances, also then pause the clock until the person comes back!
          <ul><li>If the person cannot come back for any reason, then the user needs to find someone to replace that position!</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>If there’s any natural disaster occurring around the clock, then just run for “your” life!</li>
      </ul>
