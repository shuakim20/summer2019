  Dear Autumn Furlow,
</p>

<p>
  Hello, this is Shua Kim and Sofia Soriano, from New Haven City-Wide Student Council. The student council is planning a city-wide project called, <strong><em>The City-Wide Fair Event</em></strong>. The goal of this project is to provide a variety of resources and options for students who do not plan to attend 4-year college post-high school, such as trade school, 2-year community college, working, etc. The hope is to help all students understand their post-high school options outside of the 4-year university.
</p>

<p>
  We were wondering if you would be interested in helping us out. It would be a great help if you could participate in our future career fair and provide information or resources to students by tabling your organization/trade. The tentative date for the career fair is <mark>Tuesday, April 30th from 10 AM to 1 PM at Floyd Atheltic Center of James Hillhouse High School.</mark>
</p>

<p>
  Please let us know if you would be interested in participating in this project, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. You can also contact <strong>George Black</strong>, Cheif Dream Project Director with <em>The Future Project in New Haven</em>,who is helping us with this event. He is CC'ed on this email.
</p>

<p>
  Sincerely, <br> Shua and Sofia
